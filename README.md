# About app:

Training app made in order to practise jdbc api.

Project started on May 19, 2022 and finished on May 27, 2022.

The app requires PostgreSQL. The file to create db with sql queries is uploaded in the repository.

As this is public project shared on github, developers are free to copy/paste my code in case they find it useful.
